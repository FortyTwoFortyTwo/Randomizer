For the convars that enables randomizations, several parameters can be set on how it should be randomized:
- `trigger`: Who can trigger the reroll.

- `huds.cfg`: Lists all of the netprop meters to display in hud for many weapons.
- `reskins.cfg`: List of reskins for players to equip weapon from loadout instead of default weapon.
- `viewmodels.cfg`: List of all weapons with class specified to set transparent by default, without needing to use `sm_cantsee` on weapon that covers player screen everytime.
- `weapons.cfg`: Whitelist of weapon indexs to select from random pool, along with weapon name to display in HUD.

## TF2 Updates
This plugin itself aims to not not require modifications when valve releases TF2 updates.
Gamedatas is likely to break if TF2 update were to also break other plugin's gamedata (e.g. TF2Items).
If weapon additions or rebalances were to happen, it's possible configs need an update, or possibly even plugin itself if TF2 update were to make changes only work for one class.
